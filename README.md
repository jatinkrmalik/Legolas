# Legolas
The only smart-elf slack bot you need to fight them annoying ads.

## Introduction
Hi, this is Legolas, son of Thranduil, the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. am here to help you read urls without any annoying popups or ads which I feel is Sauron's plot to drive us crazy. 

Whenever you need my help, just say _do <url>_ and I will be at your services!

## But why?
I am a crazy reddit user (should probably uninstall that app) and I have noticed sometimes I would open a link and the website will block me out because I use adblocker extension, which is super annoying TBH. 

I noticed some of the subreddits have some ad-cleaner bots which will parse the link's content and post it back in clean readable state hence bypassing those stupid adblock checks. Pretty impressive!

So, here at Shuttl, we have a pretty active slack group where a lot of urls are shared in a simillar fashion. I was getting bugged with the same problem here and couldn't find any alternative for the same so decided to get my hands dirty and create one myself. :)

## Cool story bro, how does it work?
Well, you first have to deploy this to get it to work in your channel (I might clean up code, add some features and post it in slack public library soon). 

I will be writing down the deployment process soon (need to sleep for now). Assuming you have Legolas in the slack channel you want, you just mention him with a keyword *do* followed by a url.

Example: **@Legolas do http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Legolas**

and....

### VOILA!!

_Ad-free, distraction-free inline reading without the need to even open the url._
